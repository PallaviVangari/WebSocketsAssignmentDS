# WebSocketsAssignmentDS

Created a client and server program and estanblished a web socket connection between them. 
The client sends 10000 messages. The server receives the message and adds a random number (any number between 1 to 10) before the message and sends it back to the client.
All the messages are received by client and server.

The screenshot of the terminal running the server is below:
